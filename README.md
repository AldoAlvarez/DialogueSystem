# DialogueSystem

This is a personal project in which I have developed a basic dialogue system with custom tools.
The proyect was created with Unity 2018.3.12f.

The system is divided in 3 basic elements or entities, all of which are Scriptable Objects.

  * Conversations
  * Characters
  * Dialogue Sequences
  
A Conversation contains a list of the Characters that can be used in the conversation, as well as a list of the order of the dialogues and a reference to each character.
